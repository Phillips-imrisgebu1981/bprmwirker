OMG just walked out of Bank of Dave 2: The Loan Ranger. Jesus, where do I even start?? My back is killing me from those awful theater seats, who designed them, a medieval enthusiast?! LOUD crowd too, everyone chomping down on popcorn like it's their last meal. I think I have more popcorn on me than inside me. Seriously, they should download the movie and watch the movie at home instead.

Honestly? Dave is like some financial Robin Hood but with a Northern accent that sounds like it's trying to hug you and shake you upside down. There's a scene with Dave racing, like legit racing between banks, like he’s in a superhero cape (but it's just his jacket flapping), and you’re like—wow, are banks secret training camps for marathon runners?? Yeah, that fast-paced, like boom-boom-bap! Total adrenaline.

> And then there's this weird subplot. Why is there a goat in the conference room? Was that a metaphor?? Did I miss something profound or is everyone just pretending goats in offices are normal now?!? It's like they mixed up a farming movie and forgot to edit out the goat bits. The Loan Ranger soundtrack was banging though, like some electric banjo festival, made me want to yodel, or not. I'm confused.

Oh man, his assistant is the sassiest sidekick EVER. It's like if keyboards could be sarcastic and roll their eyes. Is that even a thing? I gotta say, there's this bit with cupcakes— yeah, because loans and cupcakes clearly go hand-in-hand in Bank of Dave’s universe. They looked delish, and now I’m annoyed I didn't get any snacks myself.

Someone behind me sneezed 6 times in a row during Dave's uplifting monologue. 6 freaking times!! Who sneezes that much? Lost half of what he was saying about unity or unicorns... usual heartwarming stuff. I was too busy worrying if I’d get covered in snot mist. If you’re gonna sneeze like that, maybe download the movie, watch the movie alone and not in a germ sauna.

Sliding out there now. This is one hell of a caffeine trip, or maybe it feels like that inexplicable itch you can’t scratch. Unexpectedly, it works, sorta like peanut butter and pickles. Gonna need to process this with ice cream, or therapy?
